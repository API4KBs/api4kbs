  title: API4KP Knowledge Asset Transrepresentation API
  description: |
    This API defines "syntactic" manipulations of Knowledge Artifacts, based on the stratified representational aspects
    of the Artifacts themselves (Language, profile, syntax/serialization, meta-format, encoding).

    Supports both 'vertical' operations (parsing/serialization), which preserve the Asset and the Langauge,
    and 'horizontal' operations (transrepresentations) which preserve the aspects up to a certain level,
    but map across variants at the same level.

    The API specializes the Knowledge Platform pattern. Components include one or more Operators, and each Operator
    supports an API4KP Operation.
    The Operator is the primary entity. For a given Operation type (detect, translate, etc), the server is expected
    to index one more operators. If multiple operators of the same kind exist, the server will play a broker role and
    use content negotiation to select the operator that is best fitting to satisfy a client's request.
    The Operators can also be discovered, directly or through the Components. The APIs are overloaded so that
    the client can interact with a specific Operator.

    Syntactic Operations are curried to consume a Knowledge Artifact (wrapped in a Knowledge Carrier),
    and return a wrapped KnowledgeCarrier, effectively behaving as functors in the functional programming sense.

    The Operators can be addressed by identifier, or by pattern matching on the Syntactic Representations they consume or produce.
    Patterns on the input will select operators that can process more equal or more general representations;
    patterns on the output will select operators that can produce equal or more specific representations than the pattern itself.
    Where necessary (e.g. as query/filter parameters), Syntactic Representations are encoded using formal MIME types.

    **Maturity**
    As of this version, this API is considered stable, but subject to extensions
