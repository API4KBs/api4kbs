    This is a Terminology API built on top of the API4KP framework that provides 
    access to Terminologies and Concepts.
    
    In this context, 
    
    Terminologies are loosely defined as sets of Concepts, e.g. in the sense 
    of SKOS ConceptSchemes or Collections, or OWL Ontology Documents.
    Concepts are atomic units of knowledge that can be described/defined, can
    be related to each other, and can be evoked by means of linguistic terms.
  
    Implementations of this API can be more formal in their definition, e.g.
    by enforcing the separation of Class and Concept.
    
    This API is designed for Knowledge-Based implementations
