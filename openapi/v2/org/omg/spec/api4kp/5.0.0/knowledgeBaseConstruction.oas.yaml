  title: API4KP Knowledge Base Construction API
  description: |2

    The KnowledgeBae APIs enable the transition between Knowledge _at rest_, i.e. Knowledge in the form
    of Artifacts stored in a repository and not yet assembled into a Knowledge Base, and Knowledge
    _in motion_, i.e. Knowledge Bases deployed/paired with a runtime engine/reasoner/execution platform
    that is able to perform computations using that Knowledge.

    The Knowledge Base Construction and Composition APIs allow to compose one or more Knowledge Assets into
    Knowledge Bases that are suitable for processing/reasoning.
    The process, which is driven by metadata (surrogates), involves the retrieval, normalization,
    and structuring of Knowledge Artifacts that manifest the components of the Knowledge Base itself.

    ** Knowledge Base State **
    The Knowledge Base Management API is inspired by the State monad. Knowledge Bases are incubated
    within the server from their initialization, through their construction, until their deployment.
    As operations are applied to manipulate the KB, new versions are constructed ensuring reproducibility and traceabiilty.
    Implementations, however, are not required nor guaranteed to be transactional.

    ** Composition vs Transcreation (Mutation) Operators **
    Composition Operators allw to construct, incrementally, a Knowledge Base starting from known
    named (carriers of) Knowledge Assets.
    Transcreation operators allow to mutate Knowledge Artifacts, usually to create transient
    ephemeral versions which are used to prepare the KnowledgeBase for deployment, but would
    not otherwise be treated as Assets.
    Nevertheless, many Transcreation operations could be useful independently.
    For this reason, Transcreation operators are exposed in two different modalities:

    (i) a detached mode, where the operator is addressed independently and
    (i.a) the client is either responsible for providing the KnowledgeBase as an input, or
    (i.b) the operator is responsible for resolving the IDs provided by the client to a known KnowledgeBase,
    usually by means of delegation to a KnowledgeBase API implementation
    (ii) a connected mode, where an operator is attached to, and exposed in the context of a (client-managed)
    Knowledge Base. That is, the operator is bound to KnowledgeBase(s) at construction time, and is
    then invoked through the KnowledgeBase

    ** Service Boundaries **
    Implementations of KnowledgeBase API are likely to depend on the API4KP Knowledge Trans*ion APIs,
    to provide the necessary lifting/lowering capabilities involved in the processing of Components
    and Structures thereof.
    Implementations of Knowledge Base providers may depend on Knowledge Asset Repository implementations
    for attached operators to resolve Assets required during the processing.
    Implementations of this API are usually paired with API4KP Reasoning APIs, to provide a runtime
    for the constructed KnowledgeBases

    ** Maturity **
    As of this version, this API is considered experimental

      summary: Constructs a Composite Knowledge Asset
      description: |
        Creates a new Composite Knowledge Asset (with a new AssetID), which is manifested
        by means of its 'structure'.
        The client is responsible to provide a 'definition', expressed in some query language
        (e.g. SPARQL), which should cover both extensional (i.e. enumerated) and intensional
        (i.e. query proper) ways to select component assets and their relationships.
        The server is expected to run that definition against a substrate, such as a Knowledge
        Asset Repository.
        The server will return a KnowledgeCarrier, wrapping the graph that results from the
        application of the definition with minimal asset metadata (id, version) and information
        on how the graph itself is represented.

        The client can use the structure to assemble a Composite Asset Surrogate, or a Composite
        Artifact, which in turn could be fed to an Introspector to infer an overall Surrogate
        for the composite itself

        The flattening may require to super-impose a topology different than the one supported
        by a Composite. The strategy is left to the implementation, but the client is allowed
        to provide a hint in the form of the identifier of a 'root' component, which could be used
