    API that expose the functional capabilities of a Knowledge Artifact Repository Service (KAR), as defined in the OMG API4KP specification. 
    
    Knowledge Artifact Repositories allow to store and retrieve (copies of) Digital Knowledge Artifacts (KA).
    KARs treat KAs as black-box binary objects, so there is no limitation nor expectation on the nature of the content, or the requirements to consume it.
    However, identity and versioning must be supported.
    
    Identifiers must be universal, unique and opaque, so they MUST be UUID v4 compliant.
    Version tags can follow different patterns (semantic versioning, calendar versioning, incremental numbering, date/time stamps, etc...).
    
    Special considerations involve the _deletion_ of an Artifact. For traceability and safety purposes,
    KARs SHOULD NOT allow Artifacts to be deleted in an unrecoverable way. Deletion itself is defined as making an Artifact no longer accessible to a client (i.e. status 404).
    A server SHOULD allow a deletion operation to be undone, e.g. using mechanisms conceptually similar to 'trash bins',
    and SHOULD at a minimum keep track of the IDs of Artifacts that were at some point managed in each Repository.
    For this reason, a two phase deletion is recommended. Deleted Artifacts transition into a 'deleted' status
    in which they cannot be discovered nor retrieved, unless a dedicated flag is set. Once in a deleted state, Artifacts MAY be deleted permanently.
    
    The API also supports the (logical) federation of Repositories. A server instance MAY expose different repositories to a client,
    who should expect each repository to be independent. Whether these repositories map to actual physical repositories (e.g. different DBs),
    folder-like structures or logic tags/collections is left to the implementation.
    The same artifact (as defined by having the same ID) COULD be stored in more than one repository, but all copies MUST be identical to each other
    
    With adequate rights, and if supported by the implementation, repositories can be _enabled_ or _disabled_. 
    Enabled (resp. disabled) repositories are (resp. not) available to a client, regardless of whether the (de)allocation of actual resources is involved at the implementation level.

      In general, the ID is qualified and scoped by a scheme owned by the server.
