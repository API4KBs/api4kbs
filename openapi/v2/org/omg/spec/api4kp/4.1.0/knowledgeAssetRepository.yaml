    APIs for a Semantic Knowledge Asset Repository.

    **Knowledge Assets**
    Knowledge Assets are immutable, versioned works of knowledge (aka 'Piece of Knowledge', or 'Piece of Content'), which are expressible in any form that is fit for consumption by a designated audience.
    Assets managed through a Knowledge Asset Catalog & Repository are usually, though not necessarily, _Enterprise_ Knowledge Assets, i.e. Assets whose content is endorsed by some Subject Matter Expert (party), and whose identification and life cycle is managed by an Authority.

    **Knowledge Resources** - Assets vs Carriers vs Surrogates
    Since Knowledge Assets themselves are immaterial entities, an Asset Repository can either store 'metadata' (Knowledge Asset Surrogates), or store/reference 'manifestations' (Knowledge Carriers). Both Surrogates and Carriers are actually Knowledge Artifacts, and differ in the role they play with respect to a given Asset.
    The Asset Repository MIGHT be built on top of a Knowledge Artifact Repository, and internalize the storage of Carriers and Surrogates. An Asset Repository COULD _also_ be federated, and point to Carriers and Surrogates stored in external systems e.g. by means of URLs.
    At a minimum, the Asset Repository MUST have direct access to at least one Surrogate, which is considered Canonical, and contains some core, mandatory information about the asset and its relationships to other assets and artifacts (including Carriers and other Surrogates), and some corollary information such as  pedigree/provenance, policies, applicability.
    The Canonical Surrogate is a Resource that conforms to some standard adopted by the Repository, and is directly accessible through the Repository APIs.
    The Canonical Surrogate is such that there cannot exist two distinct Surrogates of the same Asset that use the canonical metamodel (Knowledge Representation Language, or profile thereof) supported by the server.

    Notice that all Carriers associated to an Asset MUST be iso-semantic, i.e. be _variant_ representation of the Asset knowledge content. Surrogates, on the other hand, can have different information content, as long as they refer to the same Asset, and are consistent with each other.

    **Series**
    All Resources are Versioned. Resources maintain a version-agnostic, (globally unique) ID, and a version tag which is implementation specific, even if semantic versioning is encouraged.
    Versions in a series SHOULD be ordered by version tag, based on the natural order of the tags themselves (e.g. incremental numbers vs semantic versioning). Versions SHALL also be ordered by the timestamp each version was established on.
    In particular, the LATEST version of a Resource SHALL be determined by tag ordering, and the timestamp will only be used to break any ties. (Implementations COULD use the timestamp itself as a version tag.)

    **Knowledge Graph**
    Collectively, the Canonical Surrogates constitute a Knowledge Base, of Graph-oriented nature, which is referre to as the Knowledge Asset Graph. The Graph, supports the indexing and querying of the Assets, and can be used to construct Knowledge Asset Catalogs.

    **Search and Retrieval**
    Assets (and their Carriers) MUST be discoverable through listing, and the individual Resources MUST be retrievable based on a combination of identifiers and version tags.
    Filtering SHOULD be supported based on a limited category of metadata, namely types and semantic annotations.
    Querying COULD be supported through the Knowledge Graph.
    Text based searching MIGHT be supported, but is currently outside of the scope of this specification.

    **Content Negotiation**
    Given an Asset, its Carriers and Surrogates can also be selected through Content Negotiation. A client can use a formal MIME code (see extAccept later in the documentation) to choose between (i) the Carriers or (ii) the Surrogates of a given Asset, when multiple alternatives are present.
    A client can also use Content Negotiation in combination with an Artifact identifier. In this case, the client declares their intent to access the information content of a specific Artifact (version), but asks that the Artifact be delivered in a certain format.
    To support Content Negotiation, Asset Repositories SHOULD be able to provide Artifacts even when they are not materially stored/referenced, but can be derived on the fly at runtime using a Language service API (which internally could further delegate to KB/reasoning services for complex tasks such as assembling or semantic trans*tion).

    Notice that the Asset Repository Content Negotiation is at a different level than the Content Negotiation provided by OpenAPI natively. (Formal) Content negotiation is applied _before_ a resulting Artifact (Carrier or Surrogate) is wrapped in a KnowledgeCarrier object and returned.
    Standard OpenAPI content negotiation is applied to any API return type, including KnowledgeCarriers, at a later stage.

    **Composites**
    A Composite Resource (Asset or Artifact) is a resource that consists in components, which are either Composite Resources of the same type, or regular atomic Resources. Composites are also defined by the relationships between the parts. For this reason, each Composite has a special Component, a Struct(ure), which is a graph-oriented Artifact which establishes types, roles and relationships and is normally a subset of the Knowledge Asset Graph.
    Composites are implicitly manifested through their identifier and Structure. The components can be resolved and assembled into a Composite Surrogate or into a Composite Artifact.
    The Composite is distinct from each of its components, even when one of the components has a prominent role with respect to the others.
    As such, Composites can have their own independent Canonical Surrogate, and have one or more variant Carriers.
    Notice that, in general, a Composite Asset can be carried by an atomic Carrier, and an atomic Asset can be carried by a Composite Artifact.
    Atomic Resources can be created from their Composite counterparts by means of _flattening_.


    **Service Boundaries**
    Unlike Knowledge Artifact Repositories, for which Artifacts are black boxes, Knowledge _Asset_ Repositories consider Assets and their Carriers as gray boxes.
    A Knowledge Asset Repository SHOULD delegate to a Language Service the ability to parse/serialize, validate and otherwise analyze the content of a Knowledge Carriers associated to an Asset. Language Trans*ion services SHOULD also be leveraged for Content Negotiation Purposes.
    A Knowledge Asset Repository SHOULD leverage a Knowledge Base Construction Service to manipulate artifacts, especially for the purpose of constructing, deconstructing, flattening and generating metadata.
    A Knowledge Asset Repository MIGHT also interact with a Reasoning Service, which SHOULD treat the Knowledge Asset Graph as a Knowledge Base, performing inferences and answering queries.
    A Knowledge Asset Repository SHALL NOT, instead, leverage a Reasoning Service to reason _with_ the Artifacts' content for any other reason that the extraction/validation of the Asset metadata. This choice is motivated by the different SLA constraints (e.g. security, traffic/load) involved when knowledge is 'in motion' rather than 'at rest'.

        The client-provided Carrier MUST match the Asset ID and version;
        The server SHALL use the Artifact ID and version provided by the client, which MUST not exist (the client should use setKnowledgeAssetCarrierVersion instead).

        The server MUST register the new Carrier in the Knowledge Graph, and update the Canonical
        Surrogate for the given Asset, incrementing the version of the Surrogate.

        The server COULD validate the new Carrier against the client-provided representation metadata.

      summary: Adds a (Composite) Knowledge Asset.
      description: |
        Allows a client to initialize a (Composite) Knowledge Asset, publishing metadata and registering relationships in the process.

        The client MUST provide a KnowledgeCarrier whose assetId coincides with the given Asset ID and version, and the Artifact MUST be a Canonical Knowledge Asset Surrogate for the given Asset.

        This operation is atomically equivalent to (initKnowledgeAsset o setKnowledgeAssetVersion).

        The operation MUST also supports Composite Assets. The client MUST provide a CompositeKnowledgeCarrier, which can be SET-based, TREE-based or GRAPH-based.
          The root of the (set/)tree/graph, if any, MUST NOT be the given Asset, to preserve
          the distinction between the Composite and its Components.

        If these conditions are met, the operation is invoked recursively on the components, which MUST all contain canonical Knowledge Asset Surrogates.
        The Struct MUST be merged with the repository's Knowledge Graph, and should not be inconsistent with any relationship that can be inferred from the individual Surrogates during their registration.

        Anonymous Composite Assets are treated like other Assets. The components, and relatioships thereof, will be persisted. However, the Composite itself, and the 'hasPart' relationship, will not.

        Registers a new, alternative (non-canonical) Surrogate for a given Knowledge Asset.

        The client-provided Carrier MUST match the Asset ID and version;
        The server SHALL use the Artifact ID and version provided by the client as a Surrogate Id,
        which MUST not exist, or a Conflict will be raised.

        In particular, this operation MUST not try to update the Canonical Surrogate,
        and will reject an alternative Surrogate that uses the canonical surrogate metamodel.
        (clients should use setKnowledgeAssetVersion instead)

        The server MUST register the new Surrogate in the Knowledge Graph, and update the Canonical
        Surrogate for the given Asset, incrementing the version of the Surrogate.
